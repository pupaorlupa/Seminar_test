# Seminar_test

i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i have to fall, to lose it all
in the end it doesn't even matter

one thing I dont know why
it doesnt even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind I desighned this rhyme 
to explane to you all 
all i know
time is a valuable thing
dont let it fly like a pengium wings
